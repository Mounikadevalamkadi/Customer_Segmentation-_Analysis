# Customer_Segmentation-_Analysis
1.Introduction:
Project Overview:
•	In today’s highly competitive retail landscape, understanding customer behaviour is paramount. 
•	This project aims to leverage data-driven techniques for customer segmentation using an online retail dataset. 
•	The dataset encompasses transactional data including InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
Objectives:
1.	Data Exploration and Cleaning: To prepare the data for analysis.
2.	Feature Engineering: To derive meaningful features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value from the transactional data.
3.	Customer Segmentation: To classify customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms like K-Means.
4.	Cluster Profiling and Strategy Development: To profile the resultant clusters and propose targeted marketing strategies for each segment.
2.Dataset Description
•	Data Source:  The dataset was obtained from “Kaggle”
•	Description of Features: Detailed description of each column in the dataset, including InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset, leading to these key findings:
1.	Descriptive Statistics:
•	Total Transactions: The dataset contains transactions made by various customers.
•	Customer Count: Unique Customer IDs indicate the total number of individual buyers.
•	Product Diversity: Various unique product descriptions hint at a wide range of products sold.
2.	Data Cleaning:
•	Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values, especially in critical columns like CustomerID and InvoiceDate.
•	Duplicates: Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
3.	Revenue Analysis:
•	Total Revenue: Summed up the total revenue generated by multiplying Quantity and UnitPrice.
•	Revenue by Country: Identified the top-performing countries in terms of revenue, with the UK leading significantly.
4.	Sales Trends:

•	Monthly Sales: Observed sales trends over time, highlighting peak periods and seasonal variations.

•	Day of the Week Analysis: Identified the days with the highest and lowest sales, providing insights into customer shopping behaviour.


5.	Top Products:

•	Most Popular Products: Analysed the most frequently bought items to identify 
Customer preferences.

•	Revenue-Generating Products: Highlighted the products that contributed the most to overall revenue.

6.	Customer Insights:

•	Purchase Frequency: Distribution of how often customers make purchases.

•	Customer lifetime value (CLV): Distribution of the total revenue generated by each customer.

7.	Visualization of Findings:

•	Bar Graphs: Used to display total sales by country and top products.

•	Line charts: Showed sales trends over time.

•	Histograms: Depicted purchase frequency 

•	Pie charts: Used to display top Customers by Revenue

•	Box plot and Violin plots: Illustrated the distribution of the key metrics like Monetary, Frequency, and Recency and CLV distribution.

4.Feature Engineering:
We derived three key features essential for customer segmentation:
1.	Recency: The number of days since the customer's last purchase.
2.	Frequency: The total number of purchases made by each customer.
3.	Monetary: The total revenue generated by each customer.
Process
•	Calculated the Recency by finding the difference between the most recent date in the dataset and the customer's last purchase date.
•	Determined Frequency by counting the unique InvoiceNos per customer.
•	Computed Monetary by summing the total revenue from each customer's purchases.

5.Customer Segmentation
We used K-Means clustering to segment customers based on the features derived.
Steps:
1.	Standardized the Data: Used StandardScaler to standardize the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
2.	Optimal Number of Clusters: Determined using the Elbow Method, which suggested the optimal number of clusters.
3.	Applied K-Means: Clustered the customers into groups and added the cluster labels to the dataset.
6.Cluster profiling:
Profiling each cluster to understand its characteristics:
1.	Cluster 0 - High-Value Customers:
•	These customers have low recency, high frequency, and high monetary values.
2.	Cluster 1 - At-Risk Customers:
•	High recency, low frequency, and moderate monetary values indicate they haven't purchased recently but have done so in the past.
3.	Cluster 2 - Potential Loyalists:
•	Low recency, moderate frequency, and monetary values suggest they have recently started purchasing and could become loyal customers.
4.	Cluster 3 - Casual Shoppers:
•	Moderate recency and low frequency with low monetary values indicate infrequent buyers.
7.Marketing Strategies:
Based on the cluster profiles, tailored marketing strategies were developed:
1.	High-Value Customers: Offer exclusive loyalty programs, early access to new products, and personalized recommendations.
2.	At-Risk Customers: Use re-engagement campaigns, win back offers, and personalized   follow-ups.
3.	Potential Loyalists: Encourage repeat purchases with targeted promotions, product recommendations, and nurturing campaigns.
4.	Casual Shoppers: Provide occasional discounts, reminders about sales events, and personalized content.
8.Conclusion:
•	This customer segmentation analysis provides a robust foundation for tailored marketing strategies, aiming to enhance customer satisfaction, boost sales, and improve overall business performance. 
•	Future steps could include regular monitoring of customer segments and adjusting strategies based on evolving trends and feedback.
